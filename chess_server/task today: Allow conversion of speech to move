task today: Allow conversion of speech to move

Start with one format and then expand

Should keep in mind all corner cases:
> castling (long and short)
> captures
> promotions
> pawn moves vs piece moves
> checks and not checks (and checkmates)


strategy:
> dont worry about checks or captures - can figure that out later very easily
> key things:
> - either two squares or a piece and a square (might need more data)

anomaly:
> promotion. needs a square and a promotion piece - could also be a capture or check

> you already can convert move to speech

you only need to worry about speech to move

speech examples:
> knight from g1 to/captures f3 (check)?
> pawn from e7 to/captures e8 queen

for now, work with the two squares approach
you can know promotion or not by checking the last word in speech
otherwise, you can just ask options for which piece to promote to

> also need some util to work with receiving answers to options
